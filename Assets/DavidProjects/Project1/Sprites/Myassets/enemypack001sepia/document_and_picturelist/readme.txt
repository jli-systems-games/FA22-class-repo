Thanks for your purchase.



This asset is a pixel art set of enemies for retro type 2D shooter.(2D vertical scrolling shooter) 
Each pixel art was drawn by only 4 colors.(sepia tone)  -like soft of old portable game-
Reference player machine size is 16x16 pixels.


If you want to choose purpose sprite quickly,refer the "picturelist.png" (in document_and_picturelist folder). 



<caution>
Parency bug occurs in current version of unity when you use png image in [16bit] setting,so use png image in [true color] setting. 



I am going to create another additional asset for retro type 2D shooter,so check my another asset if you feel like.
